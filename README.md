# WebDoI

A Flask Application that provides a front-end for the `howdoi` library.

# What Does It Do?

This application allows you to query a programming question and get a snippet quickly to help answer it. It pulls from Stack Overflow results based on Google. Below you will find examples of queries.

# How Do I Use It?

To start simply put a query into the search bar and press enter. A few examples of queries are:

```
iterate over list python

post data to url .net

clear stdout bash
```

You may need to word your query in a different way to get a good result. I'm looking for a way to allow for Bing and Yahoo results but I'll need to fork `howdoi` in order to do it.
